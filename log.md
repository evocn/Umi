Vision
======
A lot like hero tactics
Finished in one month and ten days
Ten levels
Some dialogue and strategy layer
No stats, only hit points and abilities.
Vary few abilities. Maybe only attack, heal, defend, freeze, and warp.
All characters have two abilities.
Those abilities have som variability in how they work. (I e they roll some small dice)
Characters upgrade their abilitis when they level up (happens after a set number of battles)
Each character has a special passive ability which radically changes how they play.
You choose from your army each stage a small squad to take. They are all so specialized you wont have a main crew.
Lets say theres a chest on a level, then you need the thief. But to attack that knight youll need the wizard, and he can also warp your knight across that gap to take out the rest of the guys. Oh, but you could bring the archer instead and just peg them from afar, etc…
Characters are defined by their big traits, not their level.
They have to play super duper differently from eachother for this to work.
The game has some anti-turtle methods.
The game is permadeath.
The game is played on larger maps p, but not extreme. Think gba fire emblem.
Since this is still small scope, we could maybe fit in some dynamic character actions, interactions between party members that are cool like the triangle attack.
Also cool would be dialogues between characters… this would be a herculean task.

So this looks like:
2 weeks - design work, playtesting, find the system that feels tight.
1 week - make ten levels.
1 week - finish ost, art, strategy layer
1 week - polish, publish.

It seems to me that the thing that keeps Fire Emblem together is its RPG
elements. Trying to think about long game while winning the short game is the
central tension of the system.

Into The Breach solves this problem by requiring absolute certainty about the
short game. You have no margin to think of anything else.

Chess has a long game, but it is because enemy moves are predictable. The
implications thereof are not, but that's the fun.

FF Tactics isn't even cohesive enough to really deliver either.

My decision in this case is between trying to go for the long game, and trying
to make a really compelling, tight short game.

To be honest, I think the short game is the right call for this game, but the
long game is what I want to go with.

It will just be far easier to get the behavior I'm looking for.
