Open questions
--------------
Permadeath?
Mission length?
Objective types?
Rogue-like elements?

General ideas
-------------
One-bit aesthetic
Four or Five-color palette
drum n bass music
15-30 minute runs (maybe even shorter)
Gather a team of different units, mix and match their interactions.

Unit ideas
----------
Directional (NSEW)
Ranged
Variety
All can be accomplished with various filters.

Special Cases, to maybe rethink things:
* Sweeping Edge (AOE in general)

Attack
* Ranged only
* Line
* Sweeping Edge

Manipulation
* Push
  * Ranged
  * Perpendicular
* Pull
  * Think about the range, how this should work.
* Warp
* Mind Control an enemy

Buffs
* Paralyze
* Speed
* Extra turn
* Shield (for the turn)
* Augment ally attack range

Passive
x Immortal
* Canto unit
  * Can move after attack
  * Move, Attack, Move
  * Attack (If in position), Move, Attack
  * Dash Unit (Move, Move, Attack)
  * Unit that can continually move if they can chain together kills.
    * Maybe to balance this, he has a turn where he is unusable, feast/famine type of deal.
x Land Stride
x Flying
x Pass
* Character that leaves land mines
  * Maybe just where you left from... Might be cool and strategic.

Mechanics
* Flanking
* Environmental Destruction
  * Change terrain generally
* Temporal Manipulator
  * More turns on time-restricted mission.
  * Some benefit if you choose to have less turns on time-restricted mission.

Terrain
-------
x Cover (Immortal)
x Half Cover (one time use cover)

x Pit (Kill if landed on)
x Land Mine (one time use pit)

x Slow

x Objective (Finish level)
x Reward (Get something nice)

* Speed Tile (Extra move this turn)
* Warp Tile (Warp this turn)
