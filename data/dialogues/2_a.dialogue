The sea is still.
The tide is low.
The Murakami watch the Wako ships approaching from the East.
Apprehension hangs in the air.

Takeda | Hear me, Murakami!
Takeda | Today, we fight for our lives, and for our honor!
Takeda | Die today, and the pirates will steal our lands.
Takeda | The Murakami will be no more.
Takeda | Defeat the pirates, however, and we claim a peace.
Takeda | A peace which only he who is powerful can know!
