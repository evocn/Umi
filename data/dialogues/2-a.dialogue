Takeda | Aki, my cousin, you will be lieutenant of our forces.
Aki | My lord, I have no experience in naval combat.
Takeda | Nor do I. We are but humble fishermen.
Takeda | It is for that reason we must be united in this.

Takeda | Gather the men, and find all the weapons you can.
Takeda | Make sure they work, as well. It has been a long time.
