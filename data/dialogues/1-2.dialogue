Ojii | Very good, young master. 
Ojii | I have remembered how to fish because of you!

Young Takeda | Good. Now we can catch twice as many! Get out another pole!

Ojii | No, I will leave it to you.

Young Takeda | But more fish would be better for the village, right?

Ojii | Answer me this, Taki. How many live on Noshima island?
Young Takeda | One-hundred and eighty-five.
Ojii | And how many men does one Ayu feed?
Young Takeda | One fish can feed three men.
Ojii | Good. Now I ask you, Taki, have we enough fish for the day?

Young Takeda | You're right! We have exactly enough fish for our village.

Ojii | Well done, young master. I am pleased.

Young Takeda | But shouldn't we catch more, in case the villagers need them later?
Young Takeda | And what if we cannot catch fish tomorrow?

Ojii | Takeda, listen well.

The old man is silent for a long time.
Takeda sits in patient curiosity beside his teacher.

Ojii | Take only what you need from the sea.
Ojii | Take too much from the sea, and the fish will all be gone.
Ojii | The sea gives graciously. We must accept what it offers.
Ojii | Do not strive for more than you can carry on your boat.
Ojii | This is the way of the Murakami.

Ojii | Remember this well, Takeda.
Ojii | We will all depend on you one day.
