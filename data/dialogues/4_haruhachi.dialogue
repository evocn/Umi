Takeda | Haruhachi, thank you for coming on this day.

Haruhachi | I am at your service, sir. Glad to fight for you.
Haruhachi | The decision to turn on Motonari...
Haruhachi | You could not have picked a better time.

Takeda | I know, cousin. It has been a long time coming.

Haruhachi | How much land has he offered you?

Takeda | 2,000 koku.

Haruhachi | Very good. The Murakami's wealth ever grows.
Haruhachi | Let's have ourselves a good fight, here.

Takeda | Aye.
