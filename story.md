Overview
========
## Prologue
It is the 102nd year without peace in Japan.
The country is divided into 99 regional clans.

The earth is marred by bloodshed and betrayal.
But the sea... The sea is untouched.

You are Takeda. Heir of the Murakami.
Your family are fishermen.
You live in peace amidst the warring age.
Noshima castle is your ancestral home.
For 250 years you have lived here.

You are assured to marry Arukahime.
You are destined to carry the banner of the Murakami.
You will be responsible for its survival in this age of turmoil.

You watched as Oda Nobunaga conquered Ishiyama Hongan-ji.
You saw the armies of the Uesugi march along the coastline.
You saw them meet their demise.

The world is at war but you live at peace.
Your family hopes not for power or land. 
You pray merely for plentiful fish and calm seas.

## Part 1 - Introduction (1575)
### 1-1 Peaceful days
* Black Screen, the sound of waves, seagulls.

Ojii | Takeda! Young master, wake up!

* Screen fades into the open sea. Ojii appears, smiling.

Ojii | It is pleasing to enjoy an afternoon nap in the sun.
Ojii | But my boy, at this rate it will include the evening and morning as well!

You awaken to find the warmest afternoon you have felt.
The cool breeze brings peace to the body and soul.

Ojii | Now that you are awake, come here.
Ojii | I must teach you as I have promised your mother.

Takeda | Ojii-san, you have already taught me to fish.
Takeda | I have been fishing since before I was eleven.

Ojii | Ah, have I? I must have forgotten. 
Ojii | The young master is very impressive. 
Ojii | Come, show me how to fish.

Takeda | Ojii-san, you already know how to fish!
Takeda | You do not need me to teach you how!

Ojii | But I am forgetful in my old age.
Ojii | A man like me must be reminded every day how to live.
Ojii | Otherwise, he will forget and stop living.

Takeda | Hahaha! I will show you how to fish. Watch carefully.

### 1-2 Tutorial Mission

### 1-3 Lesson from Ojii-san
Ojii | Very good, young master. I have remembered how to fish because of you!

Takeda | Good. Now we can catch twice as many! Get out another pole!

Ojii | No, I will leave it to you.

Takeda | But more fish would be better for the village, right uncle?

Ojii | Answer me this, Taki. How many live on Noshima island?
Takeda | One-hundred and eighty-five.
Ojii | And how many men does one Ayu feed?
Takeda | One man eats one third of a sweetfish per day... That means three.
Ojii | Good. Now I ask you, Taki, have we enough fish for the day?

Takeda | ... Actually, we have exactly enough fish for our village.

Ojii | Well done, young master. I am pleased.

Takeda | But shouldn't we catch some extra, in case the villagers need them later?

Ojii | Takeda, listen well.

The old man is silent for a long time.
Takeda sits in patient curiosity beside his teacher.

Ojii | Take only what you need from the sea.
Ojii | This is the way of the Murakami.
Ojii | Take too much from the sea, and the fish will all be gone.
Ojii | The sea gives graciously. We must accept what she offers and be pleased.
Ojii | Do not strive for more than you can carry on your boat.
Ojii | Extra fish is sure to rot, and bring disease and other bad things.

## Part 2 - Dream (1580)
### 2-1 Wako
* A quiet day. A scene of a view of the ocean from the window of a clean study.

The world is calm. You write a letter to a neighboring lord.
The sound of seagulls carries in on the breeze from without.

Takeda | That will do. Hm... 
Takeda | Perhaps the ships could carry this letter today.
Takeda | ...
Takeda | Perhaps tomorrow will do.
Takeda | Politics... So very boring...

All is still.

Suddenly, the door of your study bursts open.
It is your cousin, Aki. He is not supposed to be here until sundown.
He hastily removes his shoes, and kneels and bows to you.

Aki | Lord Takeda, pirates approach from the east. 
Aki | I came right away.
Aki | It is the Wako. I believe they mean to ransack Noshima.

Takeda | Ah! Wako, I see... After so many years of peace.
Takeda | Then the day has come.

Aki | My lord, what do you mean?

Takeda | Today the Murakami determine their own fate.

Aki | !!!
Aki | You mean... to fight them?

Takeda | How many ships were there?

Aki | Four Kobaya and one Sekibune.

Takeda | Artillery?

Aki | Arquebus, no cannons. Wait, my cousin, you must not be hasty.
Aki | The risk is enormous, and pirates are easily pleased with tribute.
Aki | Our fathers have taught us the ways of the pirates.
Aki | Would not an offering of our wealth and one maiden suffice?

Takeda | It certainly would.

Aki | Then why do you speak of fighting?

Takeda | For if the Wako recieve what they desire today,
Takeda | They will know us as the farmer knows his rice.
Takeda | They will return, year after year, to harvest.
Takeda | For that reason, we must strike decisively.
Takeda | One battle, to drive them off forever.

Takeda | Gather the men, and fetch me Haruhachi. We must be swift.

### 2-2 Pirate Skirmish
* Flashback

Takeda | Uncle, I had thought you would oppose my course of action.

Oji | Whatever the master wishes is the will of the Murakami.
Oji | I swore an oath to your father that I would obey his will,
Oji | And now I obey yours.

Takeda | ... So you will fight by my side?

Oji | I will fight, and pray for our victory.

Takeda | Good. Then scurry the boats. We ride in one hour.

---
* Flashback

Takeda | Aki, my cousin, you will be lieutenant of our forces.
Aki | My lord, I have no experience in naval combat.
Takeda | Nor do I. We are but humble fishermen.
Takeda | It is for that reason we must be united in this.

Takeda | Gather the men, and find all the weapons you can.
Takeda | Make sure they work, as well. It has been a long time.

---
* Flashback

Arukahime | My love, must you fight?

Takeda | I must. For if not for fighting, I would give up my cousin.
Takeda | Soon after, I would give up you.
Takeda | This is the way of the Murakami.
Takeda | Can you see my reasoning?

Arukahime | Yes, I see it, but it brings me no peace to see you like this.
Arukahime | You are like a man on fire. You have passion in your eyes.

Takeda | My love, hear me. I would never fight if I did not have to.

Arukahime | Takeda, I hear you, but I cannot believe what you say.
Arukahime | Why then do you read of the ways of strategy?

Takeda | My studies are for historical purposes.
Takeda | Our family fought for the Taira over three hundred years ago.
Takeda | Do you see? It is my duty as lord of our house to know of our heritage.

Arukahime | But why, then, have you trained the Murakami in spear combat?

Takeda | My love, I see now that nothing I say can convince you.
Takeda | I do not have the time to argue. I must leave soon.

Arukahime | Takeda...

### 2-3 Victory
* Portrait of the banner of the Murakami over the remains of the Wako.

Takeda | Look upon our victory, Murakami!
Takeda | The Wako are no more. They will never set foot in the Seto again!

Takeda watched the smiling faces of the Murakami.
He had never seen such glory. Never witnessed such pride.

* Fade to black

From deep within Takeda's heart, a dream began to sprout.
He was powerless to its influence.
The future rolled out before him as a long, narrow river.
He wanted nothing less than to reach the very end.

## Part 3 - Determination (1581)
### 3-1 A different path
* Another calm day in the study of Takeda.

It has been a year since the battle of south island.
The Murakami have been changed by it. They are proud, and zealous.
They tell tales of the battle late into the night.
They eat more fish than before, 
and catch extra to trade with the neighboring lordships.
They drink imported sake and play games of Shogi amongst themselves.

The fish have been plentiful. 
The men carry home enough for all Murakami by noontime.
In the afternoons, the men train in the martial arts for pleasure.
There is a pervasive joy about Noshima castle.
Takeda gleams with pride.

Ojii | Young master? Have you finished for the day?
Takeda | Yes, uncle. It is good to see you. Please, come in.
Takeda | Aruka, please fetch your father and I some tea.
Arukahime | Of course.

Ojii | I have heard a rumor by the sailors of the south island.
Ojii | They say you have commanded them to acquire a half-dozen cannons.
Ojii | Young master, I ask you, is this rumor true?

Takeda | Indeed, it is the truth.

Ojii | I ask, further, what purpose will those cannons be pointed towards?

Takeda | Uncle, do not twist my arm where it does not wish to go.
Takeda | The cannons are for defense. The Mori clan wars with the Oda.
Takeda | The great temple of Ishiyama Hongan-Ji lies under siege.
Takeda | If a Daimyo wishes to find a foothold here, we must be prepared.
Takeda | Do you see, now, the reality we find ourselves in?

Ojii | ...
Ojii | I see.

Ojii | Do you remember my lesson about the fish?

Takeda | Haha! Uncle, you have many lessons about fish.
Takeda | Have you come to reminisce about the past?
Takeda | For it is the season to do so.

Ojii | I have come to remind you of the way of the Murakami.
Ojii | I see your passion rise - you wish to bring wealth and glory to the Murakami.
Ojii | But do not forget that the sea will only give so much.
Ojii | If you catch all of the fish in the sea, then the gods will punish you.
Ojii | If your people starve, know that it will be because of you.

Takeda | Uncle... You are of the old ways, I understand that much.
Takeda | I love you, as though you were my father.
Takeda | But you are wrong in this. Times have changed.
Takeda | The Ashikaga does not command us. None command us.
Takeda | The way of your age was endurance.
Takeda | The way of mine is strength.

### 3-2 Assault
* Nightfall, under cover of rain.

Takeda | Murakami, we gather today to honor our ancestors.
Takeda | The Mori have given us a task: to destroy the camp of the Oda.
Takeda | We ride on my command. But there must be no sound.
Takeda | Wear not the crest of our house. 
Takeda | They must not know the Murakami were behind this.

Takeda | Aki, have you prepared your fleet?

Aki | Yes, my lord. The men are ready. The weapons of war are primed.

Takeda | Good. Ensure that we make a swift getaway.

* Flashback
Motonari | I am glad you could make it.
Motonari | You and your family are known far and wide for the defeat of the Wako.
Motonari | I bring you to my castle to ask of you a favor.

Takeda | Something to bring our clans closer together?

Motonari | Something to ensure our victory in the coming days.
Motonari | I have... A mission for you. It would be dangerous for my men,
Motonari | But for your family... It should provide immensely simple.

Takeda | It will be done. And in return?

Motonari | I give to you the lands north of Noshima.
Motonari | One thousand Koku. And when I am shogun, I will give two thousand more.

Takeda | I accept your offer! My lord Mori!

Motonari | Then it is settled. You are to be my admiral.

* Flashback

Aki | Are you certain, cousin? To ally ourselves with a Daimyo... 
Aki | This is not our way!
Takeda | You are mistaken, Aki. The Murakami were once warriors.
Takeda | Have you not read our history?
Takeda | We fought among the samurai on the Dan No Ura.
Takeda | We are meant for greatness such as this, not for fishing!
Takeda | Hear the men! Hear your brothers and cousins.
Takeda | They long to make our ancestors proud!

Aki | ...
Aki | All would wish for the same.
Aki | But not like this.

* Flashback

Arukahime | Takeda, your face, why do you turn it away from me?
Takeda | Aruka, you distrust my very being. 
Takeda | I have told you, it is for our own good.

Takeda | We will have powerful allies. We will never fear for our lives again!
Takeda | The Mori

The mission is a simple stealth mission with two fleets, and a great big fire
situation near the end!

I want Kuki Yoshitake to appear at the end of this one.
It would be cool if he knows that it is the Murakami right away, when no one
else does.

### 3-3 Celebration
* The morning sun arises. Celebration erupts on Noshima island.

Takeda | Victory is ours! Friends, let us eat and drink to our glory!

And so the Murakami ate and they drank.
As the sun rose over the Seto sea, the cinders of Oda Nobunaga's camp smoldered,
And the journey down the long, narrow river had begun.
