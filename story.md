### 2-3 Victory
* Portrait of the banner of the Murakami over the remains of the Wako.

Takeda | Look upon our victory, Murakami!
Takeda | The Wako are no more. They will never set foot in the Seto again!

Takeda watched the smiling faces of the Murakami.
He had never seen such glory. Never witnessed such pride.

* Fade to black

From deep within Takeda's heart, a dream began to sprout.
He was powerless to its influence.
The future rolled out before him as a long, narrow river.
He wanted nothing less than to reach the very end.

## Part 3 - Determination (1581)
### 3-1 A different path
* Another calm day in the study of Takeda.

It has been a year since the battle of south island.
The Murakami have been changed by it. They are proud, and zealous.
They tell tales of the battle late into the night.
They eat more fish than before, 
and catch extra to trade with the neighboring lordships.
They drink imported sake and play games of Shogi amongst themselves.

The fish have been plentiful. 
The men carry home enough for all Murakami by noontime.
In the afternoons, the men train in the martial arts for pleasure.
There is a pervasive joy about Noshima castle.
Takeda gleams with pride.

Ojii | Young master? Have you finished for the day?
Takeda | Yes, uncle. It is good to see you. Please, come in.
Takeda | Aruka, please fetch your father and I some tea.
Arukahime | Of course.

Ojii | I have heard a rumor by the sailors of the south island.
Ojii | They say you have commanded them to acquire a half-dozen cannons.
Ojii | Young master, I ask you, is this rumor true?

Takeda | Indeed, it is the truth.

Ojii | I ask, further, what purpose will those cannons be pointed towards?

Takeda | Uncle, do not twist my arm where it does not wish to go.
Takeda | The cannons are for defense. The Mori clan wars with the Oda.
Takeda | The great temple of Ishiyama Hongan-Ji lies under siege.
Takeda | If a Daimyo wishes to find a foothold here, we must be prepared.
Takeda | Do you see, now, the reality we find ourselves in?

Ojii | ...
Ojii | I see.

Ojii | Do you remember my lesson about the fish?

Takeda | Haha! Uncle, you have many lessons about fish.
Takeda | Have you come to reminisce about the past?
Takeda | For it is the season to do so.

Ojii | I have come to remind you of the way of the Murakami.
Ojii | I see your passion rise - you wish to bring wealth and glory to the Murakami.
Ojii | But do not forget that the sea will only give so much.
Ojii | If you catch all of the fish in the sea, then the gods will punish you.
Ojii | If your people starve, know that it will be because of you.

Takeda | Uncle... You are of the old ways, I understand that much.
Takeda | I love you, as though you were my father.
Takeda | But you are wrong in this. Times have changed.
Takeda | The Ashikaga does not command us. None command us.
Takeda | The way of your age was endurance.
Takeda | The way of mine is strength.

### 3-2 Assault
* Nightfall, under cover of rain.

Takeda | Murakami, we gather today to honor our ancestors.
Takeda | The Mori have given us a task: to destroy the camp of the Oda.
Takeda | We ride on my command. But there must be no sound.
Takeda | Wear not the crest of our house. 
Takeda | They must not know the Murakami were behind this.

Takeda | Aki, have you prepared your fleet?

Aki | Yes, my lord. The men are ready. The weapons of war are primed.

Takeda | Good. Ensure that we make a swift getaway.

* Flashback
Motonari | Welcome, Murakami.
Motonari | You and your family are known far and wide for the defeat of the Wako.
Motonari | I bring you to my castle to ask of you a favor.

Takeda | Something to bring our clans closer together?

Motonari | Something to ensure our victory in the coming days.
Motonari | I have a mission for you. It would be too dangerous for my men,
Motonari | But for you and your fleet, it should provide immensely simple.

Takeda | I see. And in return?

Motonari | I give to you the lands north of Noshima.
Motonari | One thousand Koku. And when I am shogun, I will give two thousand more.

Takeda | I accept your offer!

Motonari | Then it is settled. You are to be my admiral.

* Flashback

Aki | Are you certain, cousin? To ally ourselves with a Daimyo... 
Aki | This is not our way!
Takeda | You are mistaken, Aki. The Murakami were once warriors.
Takeda | Have you not read our history?
Takeda | We fought among the Taira on the Dan No Ura.
Takeda | We are meant for greatness such as this, not for fishing!
Takeda | Hear the men! Hear your brothers and cousins.
Takeda | They long to make our ancestors proud!

Aki | ...
Aki | I wish to make them proud as well.

Aki | ...
> Takeda

Aki | But not like this.

* Flashback

Arukahime | Takeda, your face, why do you turn it away from me?
Takeda | Aruka, you distrust my very being. 
Takeda | I have told you, it is for our own good.

Takeda | We will have powerful allies. We will never fear for our lives again!
Takeda | The Mori

The mission is a simple stealth mission with two fleets, and a great big fire
situation near the end!

I want Kuki Yoshitake to appear at the end of this one.
It would be cool if he knows that it is the Murakami right away, when no one
else does.

### 3-3 Celebration
* The morning sun arises. Celebration erupts on Noshima island.

Takeda | Victory is ours! Friends, let us eat and drink to our glory!

And so the Murakami ate and they drank.
As the sun rose over the Seto sea, the cinders of Oda Nobunaga's camp smoldered,
And the journey down the long, narrow river had begun.
